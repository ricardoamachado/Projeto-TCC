abstract = {Abstract The proposed study reports the essential parameters required for the battery charging schemes deployed for Electric Vehicle (EV) applications. Due to efficient power delivery, cost-effectiveness, and environmental acclimation, EVs have emerged as a suitable alternative to the Internal Combustion (IC)-based engines. However, prominent challenges for leveraging the EVs are the suitable availability of battery charging infrastructure for high energy/power density battery packs and efficient charging topologies. Despite the challenges, EVs are gradually being implemented across the globe to avoid oil dependency, which currently has a 5\%–7\% decline rate of post-peak production. The vast deployment of EVs as private and commercial vehicles has created a major challenge for the grids in maintaining the power quality and peak load demand. This study, therefore, reviews the various battery charging schemes (battery charger) and their impact when used in EV and Hybrid EV applications. The available constituents of the battery chargers such as ac-dc/dc-dc converter topologies, modulations, and control techniques are illustrated in detail. The comprehensive study classifies the charging topologies depending upon the power and charging level. Some appropriate battery charging converter topologies that are suitable for domestic, industrial, and commercial applications like EVs are suggested in the study. In addition, a decision-making inference is developed through a flow chart that decides on the suitable selection of the converter topology based on the required applications. Furthermore, the charging infrastructures along with the converters' design standards are also discussed concisely, which adds a significant contribution to the review article.},
